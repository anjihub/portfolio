      <h2>Visualizing Cybersecurity Attack Flows with Mermaid Diagrams</h2>
      <p><em>Aug 6, 2025 · 1 min read</em></p>

      <p>As I continue my journey into cybersecurity and digital forensics, I've found that clear visualizations are essential for understanding complex processes like network attacks. Recently, I started exploring <strong>Mermaid</strong>, a markdown-friendly tool that allows creating diagrams and flowcharts with simple text.</p>

      <p>For this project, I created sequence diagrams illustrating a typical botnet attack scenario, showing how an attacker controls compromised devices to overwhelm a target server, and how firewalls analyze and filter traffic to defend the system.</p>

      <h3>What I learned:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Practice breaking down technical attack flows into digestible steps</li>
        <li>Improve my ability to communicate complex cybersecurity concepts visually</li>
        <li>Strengthen my overall understanding of network defense mechanisms</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Though this project is small, it’s a meaningful step in documenting my learning and honing skills that are crucial in cybersecurity roles. I’m excited to keep building on this foundation with more advanced projects and deeper technical explorations.</p>

      <p>If you're interested in seeing the diagrams or want to learn more about Mermaid, check out my <a href="https://github.com/anjihub/mermaid-diagram" target="_blank">GitHub project</a>.</p>
